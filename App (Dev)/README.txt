1. 	If you haven't installed the Connector/Net installer yet. 
Kindly do so I've pushed the installer in the App(Dev) folder :)

2.	 If you're going to edit the file. Kindly copy and paste it 
anywhere outside the repo to prevent errors.

(To push the changes, just copy and paste the edited FILE/S back
in the repo then push. Also, kindly indicate the changes you made
when you commit. Before you push something, fetch -> pull
first. So you're repo would get updated before committing any changes)

3. 	Once you've opened the file. Check first if MySql.Data and
MySql.Web exist. if not right click on references - add reference
- search for MySql then check MySql.Data and MySql.Web

4.	Open the Web.xml (the one with the uppercase W)

5. 	Find connection string, change the server, userid
and password with your own server, userid and password.

Thanks!!
